# Metis Project 5: Disaster Tweets - PROPOSAL
 
### Question/need:
This project originates from a (Kaggle data science competition)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/rules]: "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets," in which competitors are challenged to use natural language processing to determine if a tweet is about a disaster, or whether it is using "disaster vocabulary" metaphorically (e.g. "The classroom erupted in applause.").
While the data is for a classification competition (supervised learning), unsupervised learning algorithms can also be applied to this problem and used to find patterns in the data.


### Data Description:
The data are split into train-test groups of 70%-30%. The train test has labels denoting a tweet as "literal disaster" or "figurative speech" In total, 10876 tweets are in the dataset.

3271 of the 7613 training tweets refer to a physical disaster.


### Tools:

I plan to use Pandas and Numpy for data handling, NLTK and/or spaCy for text preprocessing, and SKLearn for modeling.
